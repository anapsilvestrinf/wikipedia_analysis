# Analyzing Wikipedia Pages

### Project completed as part of Dataquest's Data Engineering path.

---------------------

## Introduction
Volunteer content contributors and editors maintain Wikipedia by continuously improving content. Because of this, Wikipedia has a huge library. In this project, we will implement a simplified version of the grep command-line utlity to search for data in 54 megabytes worth of articles scraped from Wikipedia. 

Our main goals are:

* Search for all occurrences of a string in all of the files.
* Provide a case-insensitive option to the search.
* Refine the result by providing the specific locations of the files.
